# secure-online-transaction-system

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a secure online transaction system. The primary objective is to create a working algorithm that ensures secure online transactions, supported by various protocols and technologies. The project also includes a front-end interface and back-end setup to demonstrate how the algorithm can be used in a real-world scenario. Additionally, guidelines are provided for other developers to use the algorithm and set up the environment for secure online transactions.

## Setup and Run Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tosinel12/secure-online-transaction-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd secure-online-transaction-system
   ```
3. Set up the virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the backend server:
   ```
   python backend/server.py
   ```
6. Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser to access the front-end interface.

## Algorithm Explanation

The secure online transaction algorithm is designed to ensure the safety and integrity of online transactions. It includes the following components:
- **Encryption**: Encrypts transaction details to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the user initiating the transaction.
- **Validation**: Checks the validity of the transaction details.
- **Logging**: Records transaction details for auditing and monitoring purposes.

The algorithm is implemented in the `algorithm.py` file and uses various protocols and technologies to ensure security.

## Front-end and Back-end Technologies

### Front-end

The front-end interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes input fields for transaction details and a submit button to initiate the transaction. The front-end code is located in the `frontend` directory.

### Back-end

The back-end setup is implemented using Python and Flask. It handles transaction requests, processes the transaction details using the secure algorithm, and sends a response back to the front-end. The back-end code is located in the `backend` directory.

## Guidelines for Secure Online Transactions

To ensure secure online transactions, follow these guidelines:
- Use strong encryption methods to protect transaction details.
- Implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
- Validate all transaction details to prevent fraudulent activities.
- Maintain detailed logs of all transactions for auditing and monitoring purposes.
- Regularly update and patch the system to address any security vulnerabilities.

For more detailed guidelines, refer to the `guidelines.md` file.
